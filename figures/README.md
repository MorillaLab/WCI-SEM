## Figure Legend (Figure 1)

- 🟠 **Orange ellipses** — Latent variables (*Constitutional Genetics*, *Inflammaging*)
- 🟩 **Green rectangles** — Observed variables (*age*, *smoking*, *obesity*, *metastatic disease*, *death*)
- **Solid blue arrows** — Hypothesized direct structural paths
- **Dashed red arrows** — Outcome pathways (metastatic disease, death)
- **Dotted arrows** — Bidirectional or uncertain relationships
